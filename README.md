# Chromium Installer

Chromium Installer was based on the repository: https://sourceforge.net/projects/crinstaller

I made some modifications to the .iss file, allowing to package the x86 and x64 version and choose which one to install automatically.

Chromium binaries are not included in the repository, download them at:

x86: https://download-chromium.appspot.com/dl/Win?type=snapshots

x64: https://download-chromium.appspot.com/?platform=Win_x64&type=snapshots

Also download the inno-setup at: https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php#stable

Unzip each version of Chromium in its respective folders and compile inno-setup.iss. ready your Chromium installer is ready.

Ultima compilação: https://github.com/fredwilliamtjr/ChromiumInstaller/releases
